This is a basic login form website made with php
It firstly takes user details for signup and validates the data with multiple constraints. 
If the data is validated, then it enters the record to the database and user can then login to the website
Basic HTML, Javascript and CSS are used to make the frontend
PHP and mysqli are used at its backend.
Once the user logins on the website, they can either register for an event or logout with the link
This project has multiple aspects and features which can be added later in the future.
Till then, enjoy!!!
